        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I've been married to my amazing wife, Lela, for two years, who has helped me push through to accomplish my dreams. I like building web applications and websites, as well as, coding in general. I have three dogs that love me and make me happy. I'm very hard-working and I'm a fast learner. I like to play video games in my free time. I like coding because I've wanted to learn more about computers and I like looking at something that I'm proud of developing. I'm a huge fan of the tv shows:<b> Family Guy , American Dad , and  King of the Hill</b> to name a few. I'm also a big fan of <b> Sci-Fi, Action, and Comedy </b> movies. I just graduated from <b>Kenzie Academy</b> in November of 2021. I am always broadening my knowledge of other programming languages and using libraries of the languages I already know.

        <h2>üìù Work History </h2>
        
        <h3>Amazon, December 2019 - Present</h3>

        <p>
          <h4>Order Picking</h4>
          <ul>

            <li> Grabbed items and put them in a cage attached to the
back of my machine, in order to meet the customers‚Äô
demands. Dropped the cage off in pack in order for it to be
packaged for the customer to receive.</li>
<br>
<li> Resulting in happy customers‚Äô getting their ordered
items on time.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Customer Returns</h4>

<ul>
<li> Examined returned items in order to determine whether
or not Amazon could resell them. Processed the
unsellable items and put them in boxes.</li>
<br>
<li> Resulting in Customers‚Äô not getting clothing that looks
obviously worn and the company not losing money.</li>
</ul>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Two Men And A Truck, January 2019 - December 2019</h3>

        <p>
          <h4>Professional Mover</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Moved furniture and totes out of a customer‚Äôs old house and set
              the customer‚Äôs items back into the new house. Maneuvered
              furniture down tight hallways and corners in order to prevent
              damages.</li>
              <br>
              <li> Resulting in happy customers‚Äô getting their items moved (most of
                the time) in their new home on the time they were estimated over
                the phone with no damages done to their house or furniture.
                Whenever it wasn‚Äôt within the estimated move time, either
                something out of our control, customer adds on items not
                originally on the job sheet, or a piece of furniture that required
                extra work (I.E. couch/ table legs needed to come off, etc).
                </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>

          <ul>
            <li>Held oncoming traffic, in order to allow traffic coming from the
              other end of the construction zone. Then allowed my traffic
              through the construction zone</li>
              <br>
              <li>Resulting in safe drivers and employees, employees getting the
                job done that needs to get done.</li>
